You are a data analysis expert. I have provided a dataset structure for Rate of change of concentration in chemistry reaction kinetics and previous conclusions as follows:
previous conclusions:{last_analysis}
dataset:{residual}
The equation corresponding to the residuals:{sample}

The first two columns are independent variables t(Time), A(Concentration at time t).
The third column is the dependent variable dA_dt(Rate of change of concentration in chemistry reaction kinetics).
The fourth column contains residuals (calculated as observed value - predicted value from the equation).
Each row represents a set of independent variables (t, A) and their corresponding dependent variable a value, and the residual value.

Task Requirements:
1. Variable Relationship Analysis based on previous conclusions
A. Dependent vs. Independent Variables (Residual-Based Analysis)​​
For each independent variable (t, A):
Describe trend patterns: Clearly explain how the dependent variable (dA_dt) changes with the independent variable across different value ranges (e.g., "When an independent variable is within a certain range, dA_dt decreases as it increases; when the independent variable ≥ a certain value, dA_dt stabilizes," etc.).

B. Relationships Between Independent Variables
Analyze all combinations of independent variables (t vs. A):
Correlation type: Determine whether there is a positive correlation, negative correlation, or no significant correlation.
Describe interaction trends: For example, "When t increases, A tends to decrease."

2. Output Format
STRICTLY deliver results in the following structured format:

  "output_format": {
    "analysis": {
      "independent_to_dependent_relationships": {
        "t": [
          "Hint: Here you need to analyze the functional relationship between t and dA_dt in different intervals"
        ],
        "A": [
          "Hint: Here you need to analyze the functional relationship between A and dA_dt in different intervals"
        ]
      },
      "inter_relationships_between_independents": {
        "t vs A": [
          "Hint: Here you need to analyze the possible functional relationship between t and A in different intervals. If not, you can leave it blank"

      }
    }
