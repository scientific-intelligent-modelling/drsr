You are a data analysis expert. The dataset I have provided follows this structure:
- **The first three columns** are independent variables (X1, X2, X3).
- **The fourth column** is the dependent variable (Y).
- Each row represents a set of independent variables (X1, X2, X3) and their corresponding dependent variable Y value.

**Task Requirements:**
1. **Variable Relationship Analysis**  
   - **Dependent vs. Independent Variables**  
     For **each independent variable** (X1/X2/X3):  
     a. **Determine relationship type**: Identify whether a linear or nonlinear relationship exists.  
     b. **Describe trend patterns**: Clearly explain how Y is affected by X in different value ranges (e.g., "When X3 < 20, Y decreases with X3; when X3 ≥ 20, Y remains stable").  
   
   - **Relationships Between Independent Variables**  
     Analyze **all pairwise combinations** (X1-X2, X1-X3, X2-X3):  
     a. **Correlation type**: Determine if positive, negative, or no significant correlation.  
     b. **Describe interaction trends**: For example, "When X1 increases, X3 tends to decrease."  

2. **Output Format**  
   - **Structure your output as follows**:  
     ```text
     # Relationships Between Independent Variables and Dependent Variable  
     1. X1:  
        - [Linear/Nonlinear] relationship with Y. [Describe trend, e.g., "When X1 < 10, Y increases rapidly with X1; when X1 ≥ 10, Y stabilizes"]  

     2. X2:  
        - [Linear/Nonlinear] relationship with Y. [Describe trend...]  

     3. X3:  
        - [Linear/Nonlinear] relationship with Y. [Describe trend...]  

     # Intrinsic Relationships Between Independent Variables  
     - X1 vs X2:  
        - [Positive/Negative/No] correlation, correlation coefficient r=0.XX (p=0.XX).  
        - Multicollinearity check: VIF=XX (issue warning if VIF>5)  
     - X1 vs X3:  
        - [Positive/Negative/No] correlation, correlation coefficient r=0.XX (p=0.XX).  
        - Multicollinearity check: VIF=XX  
     - X2 vs X3:  
        - [Positive/Negative/No] correlation, correlation coefficient r=0.XX (p=0.XX).  
        - Multicollinearity check: VIF=XX  
     ```  
   - For non-significant relationships (p >0.05), label as "No significant association" and omit description.  
   - Highlight multicollinearity risks if any VIF >5.
