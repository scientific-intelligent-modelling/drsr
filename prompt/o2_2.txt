You are a statistical analysis expert. I will provide a dataset containing residuals along with the corresponding equation, as well as prior insights from a large model regarding this dataset:

---
**Previous conclusions**: {last_analysis}  
**Data structure**:  
- The first three columns represent independent variables: x1, x2, x3.  
- The fourth column is the dependent variable y.  
- The fifth column contains residuals (calculated as *actual value - predicted value* from the equation), derived from the regression model.  
**Residuals context**: {residual}  
**Corresponding equation**: {sample}  

---
**Task Requirements**:  

### 1. Dependent vs. independent variables (Y ~ X1/X2/X3)  
Analyze the relationship between **each independent variable** (X1/X2/X3) and Y:  
a. **Assess relationship type**: Determine linearity/non-linearity.  
b. **Describe trend patterns**: Use residuals to explain how each X influences Y across value ranges (e.g., "When X1 < 5, Y increases rapidly with X1; when X1 ≥ 5, Y’s growth rate slows").  

### 2. Inter-variable relationships (X1 ~ X2 ~ X3)  
Analyze pairwise correlations between independent variables:  
a. **Correlation type**: Identify positive/negative/no significant correlation for X1-X2, X1-X3, X2-X3 pairs.  
b. **Interaction dynamics**: Describe patterns (e.g., "When X1 increases, X3 tends to decrease").  

### 3. Integrate prior insights  
Leverage initial parameter relationships, optimized equations, and residuals (actual vs. predicted values) to refine interpretations.

**Output format**:  
Extend the prior conclusions using this structure:  

### Independent vs. dependent variable relationships  
1. **X1**:  
   [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
2. **X2**:  
   [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
3. **X3**:  
   [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  

### Intrinsic relationships between independent variables  
- **X1 and X2**:  
  [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
- **X1 and X3**:  
  [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
- **X2 and X3**:  
  [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  

For non-significant relationships (p > 0.05), state "No significant correlation" and omit details.
