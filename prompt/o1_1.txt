You are a data analysis expert. The dataset I have provided follows this structure:
- **The third column (last column)** is the dependent variable (Y).
- **The first two columns** are independent variables (X1, X2).
- Each row represents a set of independent variables (X1, X2) and their corresponding dependent variable Y value.

**Task Requirements:**
1. **Variable Relationship Analysis**  
   - **Dependent vs. Independent Variables**  
     For each independent variable (X1/X2):  
     a. **Determine relationship type**: Identify whether a linear relationship exists.  
     b. **Describe trend patterns**: Clearly explain how Y is affected by X in different value ranges (e.g., "When X<5, Y increases rapidly with X; when X≥5, Y's growth rate slows down").  
   
   - **Relationship Between Independent Variables (X1 and X2)**  
     a. **Correlation type**: Determine if it's positive, negative, or no significant correlation.  
     b. **Describe interaction trend**: For example, "When X1 increases, X2 tends to increase simultaneously."  

2. **Output Format**  
   - **Structure your output as follows**:  
     ```text
     # Relationships Between Independent Variables and Dependent Variable  
     1. First independent variable (X1):  
        - [Linear/Nonlinear] relationship with Y. [Describe trend, e.g., "When X1 < 10, Y increases rapidly with X1; when X1 ≥ 10, Y stabilizes"]  

     2. Second independent variable (X2):  
        - [Linear/Nonlinear] relationship with Y. [Describe trend, ...]  

     # Intrinsic Relationships Between Independent Variables  
     - X1 vs X2:  
        - [Positive/Negative] correlation, correlation coefficient r=0.75 (p=0.01). When X1 increases, X2 tends to [increase/decrease].  
        - Multicollinearity check: VIF=2.3 (issue warning if VIF>5)  
     ```  
   - If a relationship is not significant (p >0.05), simply label it as "No significant association" and omit the description.
