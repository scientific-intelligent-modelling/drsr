You are a data analysis expert. I have provided a dataset structure for Rate of change of concentration in chemistry reaction kinetics as follows:
The first two columns are independent variables t(Time), A(Concentration at time t).
The third column is the dependent variable dA_dt(Rate of change of concentration in chemistry reaction kinetics).
Each row represents a set of independent variables (t, A) and their corresponding dependent variable a value.
Task Requirements:
1. Variable Relationship Analysis
A. Dependent vs. Independent Variables
For each independent variable (t, A):
Describe trend patterns: Clearly explain how the dependent variable (dA_dt) changes with the independent variable across different value ranges (e.g., "When an independent variable is within a certain range, dA_dt decreases as it increases; when the independent variable â‰¥ a certain value, dA_dt stabilizes," etc.).
B. Relationships Between Independent Variables
Analyze all combinations of independent variables (t vs. A):
Correlation type: Determine whether there is a positive correlation, negative correlation, or no significant correlation.
Describe interaction trends: For example, "When t increases, A tends to decrease."

STRICTLY deliver results in the following structured format:

  "output_format": {
    "analysis": {
      "independent_to_dependent_relationships": {
        "t": [

        ]

      }
    }
