       You are a statistical analysis expert. I will provide a dataset containing residuals along with the corresponding equation, as well as prior insights from a large model regarding this dataset:

        Previous conclusions: {last_analysis}
        The last column shows residuals (calculated as actual value - predicted value from the equation), derived from the regression model.
        The first three columns represent variables: ​​x1​​, ​​x2​​ (independent variables), and ​​y​​ (dependent variable).
        Each row contains a set of independent variables, the dependent variable, and its corresponding residual value. {residual}
        Corresponding equation: {sample}
        ​​Task Requirements:​​

        ​​Conduct deeper analysis of variable relationships using residuals​​
        ​​Dependent vs. independent variables (Y ~ X1/X2)​​
        Analyze the relationship between each independent variable (X1/X2) and Y:
        a. ​​Assess relationship type​​: Determine whether a linear relationship exists.
        b. ​​Describe trend patterns​​: Using residuals, clarify how X influences Y across different value ranges (e.g., "When X < 5, Y increases rapidly with X; when X ≥ 5, Y’s growth rate slows.").
        ​​Inter-variable relationship (X1 ~ X2)​​
        a. ​​Correlation type​​: Identify positive, negative, or no significant correlation.
        b. ​​Interaction dynamics​​: Describe patterns like "When X1 increases, X2 tends to increase as well."
        ​​Refine your interpretation by integrating prior insights​​
        Incorporate the initial understanding of parameter relationships, the optimized equation, and residuals (actual vs. predicted values) to enhance your analysis.
        ​​Output format​​
        ​​Extend the prior conclusions using the following structure​​:

        # Independent vs. dependent variable relationships  
        1. First independent variable (X1):  
        [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
        2. Second independent variable (X2):  
        [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  

        # Intrinsic relationship between independent variables  
        - X1 and X2:  
        [Your analysis, combining prior conclusions with residual insights]  
        For non-significant relationships (p > 0.05), simply state ​​"No significant correlation"​​ and omit further details.
